# Scribbit

### Implicit where convenient, verbose where it counts.

![Scribbit Logo, because let's be real. Your programming language isn't real if it doesn't have one](./media/icons/scribbit.svg)

A very feature incomplete language I'm making both for fun and to learn more about compilers.

## Fundamentals

1. Staticly & strongly typed.
2. Support for both proceedural and object oriented design patterns.
